## Supported Versions

Only the docker image with the latest version of Mojo (MAX) is supported with
security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability in the latest docker image, email the maintainer
<olivier.benz@b-data.ch>.

## Vulnerabilities in Prior Versions

Vulnerabilities in docker images with prior versions of Mojo (MAX) are not
fixed.

Whenever a new version of Mojo (MAX) is released, the previous version's docker
image is rebuilt once again and then frozen.

Docker images *may* be rebuilt or extended if they fail to start or have runtime
issues.
